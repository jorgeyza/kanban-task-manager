# Kanban Task Management

![Vercel](https://therealsujitk-vercel-badge.vercel.app/?app=kanban-task-management)

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`. UI design by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

Web app for task management. Used PlanetScale for the database(MySQL-compatible). Users are able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes

To start project use `pnpm dev`. You can see the [live application here](https://kanban-task-manager.jorgeyza.com)
